# Roll20 NPC Importer, for 5e OGL
A module for FoundryVTT, used to import DND5e NPC sheets from the popular Roll20 application

Download and put the roll20npcimporter folder into FoundryVTT/public/modules

Instructions to import NPCs from Roll20:
1. Have the browser plugin VTT Enhancement Suit (https://ssstormy.github.io/roll20-enhancement-suite/features.html)
2. Open the Roll20 game containing the NPC and open the sheet
3. Use the export function in the "Export and Overwrite" tab
4. Select the .json file(s) you wish to import
5. press import

Known shortcomings to be fixed in the future:
- Fallback in case spellslots coming through as 0
- shaped sheet support


Big thanks to Atropos for troubleshooting and Sillvva for providing a good example with the DNDBeyond importer.
